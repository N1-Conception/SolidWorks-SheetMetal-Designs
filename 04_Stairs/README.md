# üèóÔ∏è Crossover Stairs ‚Äì SolidWorks Design Sheetmetal X Weldments

This project showcases a **Crossover Stairs** model created in **SolidWorks** using a combination of **Weldments** and **Sheet Metal** features.  
The design is intended for industrial walkways and safe access over obstacles such as pipelines, conveyors, or restricted zones.

---

## üîπ Features

- **Weldments**

  - Structural members used for stair stringers, handrails, and support frames.

  - Custom profiles for accurate beam and pipe representations.

  - Weld bead representation for realistic fabrication visualization.

- **Sheet Metal**

  - Stair treads and landing platforms modeled with sheet metal tools.

  - Bend allowances and reliefs considered for real-world manufacturing.

  - Flat pattern views available for fabrication drawings.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Applications

- Industrial walkways & maintenance access

- Crossing conveyors, pipelines, or equipment zones

- Modular staircase design for factories or plants
